# Spatial Maths for Python

Spatial maths capability underpins all of robotics and robotic vision.  The aim of the `spatialmath` package is to replicate the functionality of the MATLAB&reg; Spatial Math Toolbox while achieving the conflicting high-level design aims of being:

* as similar as possible to the MATLAB function names and semantics
* as Pythonic as possible

More detailed design aims include:

* Python3 support only
* Use Python keyword arguments to replace the RTB string options supported using `tb_optparse`
* Use `numpy` arrays for all rotation and homogeneous transformation matrices, as well as vectors
* Functions that accept a vector can accept a list, tuple, or `np.ndarray`
* By default all `np.ndarray` vectors have the shape `(N,)` but functions also accept row `(1,N)` and column `(N,1)` vectors.  This is a gnarly aspect of numpy.
* Unlike RTB these functions do not support sequences, that functionality is supported by the pose classes `SO2`, `SE2`, `SO3`, `SE3`.

Quick example:

```
import spatialmath as sm

R = sm.SO3.Rx(30, 'deg')
print(R)
   1         0         0
   0         0.866025 -0.5
   0         0.5       0.866025
```
which constructs a rotation about the x-axis by 30 degrees.


## Low-level spatial math

First lets import the low-level transform functions

```
>>> from spatialmath.base.transforms import *
```

Let's start with a familiar and tangible example:

```
>>> rotx(0.3)
array([[ 1.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ],
       [ 0.        ,  0.95533649, -0.29552021],
       [ 0.        ,  0.29552021,  0.95533649]])

>>> rotx(30, unit='deg')
Out[438]:
array([[ 1.       ,  0.       ,  0.       ],
       [ 0.       ,  0.8660254, -0.5      ],
       [ 0.       ,  0.5      ,  0.8660254]])
```
Remember that these are `numpy` arrays so to perform matrix multiplication you need to use the `@` operator, for example

```
rotx(0.3) @ roty(0.2)
```

Note that the `*` operator performs element-wise multiplication, equivalent to the MATLAB `.*` operator.

We also support multiple ways of passing vector information to functions that require it:

* as separate positional arguments

```
transl2(1, 2)
Out[442]:
array([[1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 1., 2.],
       [0., 0., 1.]])
```

* as a list or a tuple

```
transl2( [1,2] )
Out[443]:
array([[1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 1., 2.],
       [0., 0., 1.]])

transl2( (1,2) )
Out[444]:
array([[1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 1., 2.],
       [0., 0., 1.]])
```

* or as a `numpy` array

```
transl2( np.array([1,2]) )
Out[445]:
array([[1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 1., 2.],
       [0., 0., 1.]])
```

trplot example
packages, animation

There is a single module that deals with quaternions, unit or not, and the representation is a `numpy` array of four elements.  As above, functions can accept the `numpy` array, a list, dict or `numpy` row or column vectors.

```
>>> from spatialmath.base.quaternion import *
>>> q = qqmul([1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8])
>>> q
array([-60,  12,  30,  24])
>>> qprint(q)
-60.000000 < 12.000000, 30.000000, 24.000000 >
>>> qnorm(q)
72.24956747275377
```


## High-level classes

```
>>> from spatialmath import *
>>> SO2(.1)
[[ 0.99500417 -0.09983342]
 [ 0.09983342  0.99500417]]
```

These classes abstract the low-level numpy arrays into objects that obey the rules associated with the mathematical groups SO(2), SE(2), SO(3), SE(3) as well as twists and quaternions.  pose classes `SO2`, `SE2`, `SO3`, `SE3`.

Using classes ensures type safety, for example it stops us mixing a 2D homogeneous transformation with a 3D rotation matrix -- both are 3x3 matrices.

These classes are all derived from two parent classes:

* `RTBPose` which provides common functionality for all
* `UserList` which provdides the ability to act like a list

The latter is important because frequnetly in robotics we want a sequence, a trajectory, of rotation matrices or poses.  However a list of these items has the type `list` and the elements are not enforced to be homogeneous, ie. a list could contain a mixture of classes.

Another option would be to create a `numpy` array of these objects, the upside being it could be a multi-dimensional array.  The downside is that again the array is not guaranteed to be homogeneous.


The approach adopted here is to give these classes list superpowers.  Using the example of SE(3) but applicable to all

```
T = transl(1,2,3) # create a 4x4 np.array

a = SE3(T)
a.append(a)  # append a copy
a.append(a)  # append a copy
type(a)
len(a)
a[1]  # extract one element of the list
for x in a:
  # do a thing
```

## Symbolic support

Some functions have support for symbolic variables, for example

```
import sympy

theta = sym.symbols('theta')
print(rotx(theta))
[[1 0 0]
 [0 cos(theta) -sin(theta)]
 [0 sin(theta) cos(theta)]]
```

The resulting `numpy` array is an array of symbolic objects not numbers &ndash; the constants are also symbolic objects.  You can read the elements of the matrix

```
a = T[0,0]

a
Out[258]: 1

type(a)
Out[259]: int

a = T[1,1]
a
Out[256]:
cos(theta)
type(a)
Out[255]: cos
```
We see that the symbolic constants are converted back to Python numeric types on read.

Similarly when we assign an element or slice of the symbolic matrix to a numeric value, they are converted to symbolic constants on the way in.



```
T[0,3] = 22
print(T)
[[1 0 0 22]
 [0 cos(theta) -sin(theta) 0]
 [0 sin(theta) cos(theta) 0]
 [0 0 0 1]]
```
but you can't write a symbolic value into a floating point matrix

```
T=trotx(0.2)

T[0,3]=theta
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "<ipython-input-248-b6823f58f38d>", line 1, in <module>
    T[0,3]=th

    raise TypeError("can't convert expression to float")
